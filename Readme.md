# Belly Button Biodiversity Interactive Dashboard
An interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

**Objetive:** Deploy a Plotly project to GitHub Pages.

### Plotly

- Read a Json file using D3 library.
- A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- A bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Display the individual's demographic information.
- Update all of the plots any time that a new individual is selected.

### Gauge Chart

- A Gauge Chart that plots the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
- The chart updates whenever a new individual is selected.

## Deployment

The dashboard is deployed in a GitHub Page. This is the link for [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://alex8ab.github.io/plotly-challenge/) or type https://alex8ab.github.io/plotly-challenge/ . Consult [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) for reference.
