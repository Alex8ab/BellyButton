# Plotly-challenge
Interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

**Objetive:** Deploy a Plotly project to GitHub Pages.

### Step 1: Plotly

- Use D3 library to read a json file.
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Display the individual's demographic information.
- Update all of the plots any time that a new individual is selected.

### Bonus: Gauge Chart

- Adapt the Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
- Update the chart whenever a new individual is selected.

## Deployment

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Be sure you have your index.html in your root folder and it works with the routes for read the json files. Consult [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) for reference.
